I am a passionate student developer interested in web development. 
I enjoy learning new technologies, building small projects, and collaborating with the developer community.

My current focus includes:
- HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript
- Writing clean and readable code
- Learning through real-world projects and open-source contributions

I am always eager to learn, improve my skills, and contribute meaningfully to open-source projects.
